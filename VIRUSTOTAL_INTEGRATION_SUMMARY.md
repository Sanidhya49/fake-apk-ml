## 🧠 **How the UNBEATABLE Detection Works**

### **Detection Priority (Highest to Lowest)**

1. **🚨 Threat Feed Match** (95% confidence)
   - Known malicious APK in our database
   - Instant blocking, no further analysis needed

2. **🦠 VirusTotal: 5+ Engines** (95% confidence)
   - 5+ antivirus engines detect as malicious
   - Very high confidence detection

3. **⚠️ VirusTotal: 2-4 Engines** (85% confidence)
   - 2-4 engines detect as malicious
   - High confidence detection

4. **🔍 VirusTotal: 3+ Suspicious** (60% confidence)
   - 3+ engines detect as suspicious
   - Medium confidence, combines with ML

5. **🤖 Machine Learning** (Variable confidence)
   - AI analysis based on APK features
   - Fallback when VirusTotal unavailable

### **Smart Decision Logic**

```python
# Example decision flow:
if threat_feed_match:
    return "FAKE (95% confidence) - Known malicious"
elif virustotal_malicious >= 5:
    return "FAKE (95% confidence) - 5+ engines detected"
elif virustotal_malicious >= 2:
    return "FAKE (85% confidence) - 2+ engines detected"
elif virustotal_suspicious >= 3:
    return "FAKE (60% confidence) - Suspicious behavior"
else:
    return ml_prediction  # AI-based decision
```
